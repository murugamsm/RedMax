# RedMax
An "Operating System" that runs in a C# Console App.

RedMax is an Operating System type application. It is a Console Application, which means you use commands to use instead of using a mouse. It has been based on Command Line Operating Systems such as MS-DOS and SSH. The commands use a prefix of `$`, and depending on the command you want to use `$.`

## User Profiling System (UPS)
RedMax uses a UPS, which is the User Profiling Service, sometimes refered to as System, and you can change your profile type from the default `System`, to any other type.
### The Different Types
The way that RedMax determines your Profile Type is through integers, `0` is the default "SYSTEM" account, `1` is a "System Administrator Account", `2` is a "User Administrator, `3` is a Guest Account and `4` is a Temporary Account.

# Things that we are planning on adding
We, and by 'we' I mean 'me', are planning to add a "System Preferences" applet, so that you can customize the look of the RedMax User Interface. This *should* be added in with `Build 0.01b`

# System Requirements
### Minimum
Microsoft Windows 7 SP1
2GB RAM
Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2
x86 Based Processor, 32-bit Operating System

Windows 10 should cover that, and most laptops have 2GB RAM, and Windows 8, 8.1 and 10 come with Microsoft .NET Framework
